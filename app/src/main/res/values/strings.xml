        when you eat a food that food gives out a flavor sensation to your nutrients.
        so when you start to become deficient in those nutrients your body can submit a
        craving signal to go eat that food to get those nutrients back to where they need to be.\n\n

        the problem however is that processed food manufacturies know this and have muddied
        up the waters of this post-ingested feedback. giving us a biological interference that
        makes it impossible to get the right feedback from our inner guidance intelligence system.\n\n

        So the big takeaway is that chronic nutrient deficiency leads to chronic overeating and
        that Chronic nutrient deficiency also leads to chronic hunger.
        so it possible that your body eventually is in deficiency of almost every single
        nutrient that they need to actually thrive and let you be the best version of yourself.\n\n

        How to help to reduce the impact of hyper-palatable food
        is chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps to reduce the urge to eat hyper-palatable foods
        (Fake foods) and also to reduce neural inflammation. anything green like green leafy
        vegetables is gonna be a good source of chlorophyll.
        but you also have super dense sources of chlorophyll like chlorella, spirulina\n\n

        How to turn my inner guidance intelligence system ON
        I need to learn to connect what I eat with how I feel.  (take in food= get out how I feel)
        I could have a journal that tracks how my digestive process feels.
        how your body feel could be anything from muscle fatigue stomach discomfort, blooded.
        I need to learn to trust my inner intelligence (my subjective experience)
        instead of focus on objective measurements.
