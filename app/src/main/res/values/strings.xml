    when you eat a food that food gives out a flavor sensation to your nutrients.
    so when you start to become deficient in those nutrients your body can submit a
    craving signal to go eat that food to get those nutrients back to where they need to be.\n\n

    the problem however is that processed food manufacturies know this and have muddied
    up the waters of this post-ingested feedback. giving us a biological interference that
    makes it impossible to get the right feedback from our inner guidance intelligence system.\n\n

    So the big takeaway is that chronic nutrient deficiency leads to chronic overeating and
    that Chronic nutrient deficiency also leads to chronic hunger.
    so it possible that your body eventually is in deficiency of almost every single
    nutrient that they need to actually thrive and let you be the best version of yourself.
